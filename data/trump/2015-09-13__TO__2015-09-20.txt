Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great

If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!

If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!

This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.

Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!

Every poll done on debate last night, from Drudge to Newsmax to Time Magazine, had me winning in a landslide. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

Will be heading over to the debate soon. Can you believe @CNN is "milking" it for almost 3 hours? Too long, too many people on stage!

I hope Arnold S. does well with the Apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because I get a big percentage of the profits!

The polls are really looking good—#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist & special interest $ being spent against me. I’m turning down millions.

.@club4growth asked me for $1 million. I said no. Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes. I’ll lower big league for middle class.
