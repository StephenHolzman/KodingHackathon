Sarasota was an unbelievable success. We expected 5,000, a record, but 12,000 showed up! Great love in the air!

The failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me. Yesterday 3 boring articles, today2!

I do not know the reporter for the @nytimes, or what he looks like. I was showing a person groveling to take back a statement made long ago!

The numbers at the @nytimes  are so dismal, especially advertising revenue, that big help will be needed fast. A once great institution-SAD!

So, since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write. Incompetent!

The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. Their great old headquarters-gave it away! So dumb

The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. With unfunded liabilities-big trouble!
