Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right!

Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing.

Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally  speaking up. Just politicians!

How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? Very sad!

I had 15,000 people in Phoenix but @politico said "the rooms capacity is just over 2000." But said Bernie  Sanders had 11,000 in same room.

Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. I would never condone violence.

How crazy - 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year. This must stop. Unaffordable and not right!

Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term "anchor babies," offensive. Now he wants to use it because I use it. Stay true to yourself!
