This election is not just about electing a President. Far more significantly, it is about transforming America.

We have to ask ourselves, “Is it morally acceptable, is it economically sustainable, that so few have so much while so many have so little?”

I worry very much that our country, both economically and politically, is sliding into oligarchy.

If you study hard, I want you to be able to get a college education no matter the income of your family.

I voted against the war in Iraq, and knew it was the right vote then, and most people recognize it was the right vote today.

To me, Democratic Socialism means democracy. It means creating a government that represents all of us, not just the wealthiest people.

Yesterday's attack on Planned Parenthood in Claremont, NH, is nothing less than a violent assault on women’s health. These attacks must end.

I've got a message for corporate America: if you want us to buy your products, you better start producing them here in the United States.

If we could bail out Wall Street, we can make sure that every American can go to college without going into debt.

I am a candidate who will take on the pharmaceutical industry to demand that prescription drug costs in this country are reduced.

We need a progressive income tax so we don’t have a situation where billionaires end up paying an effective tax rate lower than nurses.
