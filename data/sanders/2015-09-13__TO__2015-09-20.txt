There is nothing that is more important than passing on a Mother Earth that is healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren.

The debate is over. Climate change is real and caused by human activity. It's already causing devastating problems around the world.

Private prisons are not cheaper, they are not safer, and they do not provide better outcomes for either the prisoners or the state.

We need a movement which tells the Koch brothers and the billionaire class that they cannot continue to buy candidates and elections.

Today's House vote to defund @PPFA is nothing more than a right-wing attack against women. Part of a war we won't let them win.#IStandWithPP

The ridiculous arrest of Ahmed and awful comments at @realDonaldTrump's rally show us we must stand strong against anti-Muslim bigotry.

Congress bailed out Wall St. because it was too big to fail. In my view, if a bank is too big to fail, it's too big to exist. Break 'em up.

I don’t take corporate PAC money, and if, by some accident, some company sent us money, we would send it back—absolutely.

Trump must apologize to the president and American people for continuing the lie that the president is not an American and not a Christian.

At the end of the day money doesn’t always win. And what this campaign is showing is that millions of people agree.

We need to provide a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants in our country and we need to keep families together.

Like any other public official, when a police officer breaks the law, that officer must be held accountable.

Health care as a right is is not utopian. It is not ‘high in the sky’ thinking. In fact, every other major country already does it.
