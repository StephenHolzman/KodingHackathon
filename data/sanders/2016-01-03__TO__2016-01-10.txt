If you don't want some right-wing extremist in the White House, you're looking at the candidate who can beat them.

Next time you hear a politician talking about “family values,” you may want to ask whether they support measures which really help families.

Right now a billionaire pays the same amount of money into Social Security as someone who makes $118,500 a year. It’s time for a change.

The test of a great nation is not how many wars it can engage in, but how it can resolve international conflicts in a peaceful manner.

We will win in 2016. Not just the White House and the Congress, but Statehouses all across the country. #iacaucus

This campaign is not about electing Bernie Sanders for president. It is about creating a grassroots political movement. It’s about you.

Just like Social Security, paid family and medical leave is a program that workers would pay into. Just $1.61 a week for the average worker.

Over 20 percent of mothers who have jobs in America have to go back to work just two weeks after giving birth. That’s unacceptable.

The environment is not for corporations to exploit today, but a treasure to preserve for future generations to enjoy.

They will not support a candidate who wants to give huge tax breaks to billionaires like himself.

The American people will not support a candidate trying to divide us up by where we came from.
