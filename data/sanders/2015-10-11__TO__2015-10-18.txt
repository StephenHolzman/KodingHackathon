The Koch brothers will spend more money in this election cycle than either the Democratic or Republican parties. This is not democracy.

The U.S. remains the only major country that does not guarantee health care for all as a right. This is wrong and we are going to change it.

It is a national disgrace that millions of full-time workers are are forced to work two or three jobs just to pay their bills.

I am running because I know we must change course now, or risk losing the future for so many to the interests of so few.

In my view, there is no justice when the 15 wealthiest people in America in the last 2 years, saw their wealth increase by $170 billion.

The debate is over. Climate change is real. It is caused by human activity. It is already causing devastating problems around the world.

What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires.

When you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right, except the United States.

I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires.

No Republican or anyone up here can address these problems unless millions stand up to the billionaire class.

Under a GOP majority in the House, Bernie was called the “amendment king” for passing more amendments than any other lawmaker. #DemDebate
