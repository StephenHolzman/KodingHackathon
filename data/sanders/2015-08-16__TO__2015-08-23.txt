For too long, the billionaire class has corrupted our political system. We must act decisively to make our economy fair again.

It’s no big surprise that in recent years, most major Republican politicians have chosen to deny that climate change even exists.

We should be spending our money on health care and disease prevention, not on paper pushing and debt collection.
