It's time to break up the big banks. If they're too big to fail, they're too big to exist. That's the bottom line.

For 30 years I've stood up for workers in this country, and I believe I am the only candidate now prepared to take on the billionaire class.

The Senate just put the interests of powerful multi-national corporations, drug companies and Wall Street ahead of the needs of our workers.

In this economy, college is the new high school. We need to make it affordable for all Americans so that we can compete on the world stage.

Let's invest in young people by making tuition free at all public colleges. Today, I will introduce a revolutionary bill to do just that.

I believe that in a democratic, civilized society none of our people should be hungry or living in desperation.
