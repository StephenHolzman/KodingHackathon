We need a massive federal jobs program which puts millions of our people back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.

We are the richest country in the world but that means nothing when almost all of the wealth and income ends up in the hands of the few.

Trade agreements should not just work for corporate America. They have got to benefit the working families of our country.

The United States must move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. Health care is a right not a privilege.

We need to fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements so that our largest export does not become decent-paying American jobs.

Today, the top 0.1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%, and one family owns more than the bottom 42%.

Over a period of a few years the national minimum wage should be $15 per hour.
