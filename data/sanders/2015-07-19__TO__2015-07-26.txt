Instead of encouraging more people to vote, Republicans have passed laws to keep people away from the polls, especially low-income people.

I hope it’s clear how dire it is for millions of people working full time yet living in poverty. We have a moral obligation to help them.

I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of the Equality Act. These protections are long overdue. #EqualityForward

It would be very hard to imagine a white middle class woman being treated in the same way as Sandra Bland was.

Our political system is dominated by billionaire campaign contributors and their lobbyists and is moving us in the direction of oligarchy.

This country is in serious trouble. Our economic system benefits the rich and large corporations and leaves working families behind.
