This campaign isn't just about electing Bernie Sanders. It's about the needs of the American people & the ideas to address those needs.

Clearly, if we are going to save the middle class and protect our planet, we need to change the political dynamics of the nation.

A nation will not survive morally or economically when so few have so much, while so many have so little.

Since the Wall Street crash of 2008, more than 58% of all new income has gone to the top 1%. America needs a political revolution.

We must end the scandal in which millions of American employees work 50 or 60 hours a week and earn no overtime.

The skyrocketing level of income and wealth inequality is not only grotesque and immoral, it is economically unsustainable.

I am calling on all of us in public life, including my fellow candidates for president, and all Americans to condemn anti-Muslim hatred.
