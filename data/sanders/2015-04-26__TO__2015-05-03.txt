Democratic socialism means that we have government policy which does not allow the greed of the fossil fuel industry to destroy our planet.

Democratic socialism means that in a democratic, civilized society the wealthiest people and largest corporations must pay their fair taxes.

Democratic socialism means that if someone works forty hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty.
