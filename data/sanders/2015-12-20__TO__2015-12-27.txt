I'm running for president because it is harder than ever for students to pay for college and for working parents to afford daycare.

I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq.

It's time to end religious bigotry and build a nation in which we all stand together and condemn the anti-Muslim rhetoric we're hearing.

Every man, woman and child in our country should be able to access quality care regardless of their income.

In my view, some of the real heroines in our country today are single moms.

I'm running for president because the middle class is disappearing and more than half of new income is going to the top 1 percent.

We must take steps to protect children and families seeking refuge here, not cast them out.

Very disturbed by reports that the government may commence raids to deport families who've fled here to escape violence in Central America.

When they divide us up, they win. When we stand together as one people, we win.

We should not be firing teachers, we should be hiring teachers. School teachers and educators are real American heroes.

Don't know how to break this to you, but Trump has discovered that women go to the bathroom. And it's upsetting him.

You want to keep the minimum wage low, and give tax breaks to millionaires. @realDonaldTrump, that is not what makes America great.

We cannot jail our way out of health problems like drug addiction or social and economic problems like poverty.

We have to ask ourselves, “Is it morally acceptable, is it economically sustainable, that so few have so much while so many have so little?”

This election is not just about electing a President. Far more significantly, it is about transforming America.

There is nothing that is more important than passing on a Mother Earth that is healthy and habitable for our kids and grandchildren.

The debate is over. Climate change is real and caused by human activity. It's already causing devastating problems around the world.
