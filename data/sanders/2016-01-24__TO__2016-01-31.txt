Instead of cutting head start and childcare, we need to move to a universal pre-k system for all the children of this country.

A living wage should not only be fair, it should be equitable. We must pass pay equity for women workers. #EqualPayCantWait

If I’m president, will Wall Street like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I’m president? You better believe it.
