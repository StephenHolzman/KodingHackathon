Today, we have 45 million people living in poverty. This campaign is about those people and our struggling middle class. #NotTheBillionaires

This campaign is not about electing Bernie Sanders for president. It is about creating a grassroots political movement in this country.

We must move away from the militarization of police forces and we must invest in community policing.

Across the nation, too many find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals.
