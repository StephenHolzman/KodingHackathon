Since the Wall Street crash of 2008, more than 99% of all new income has gone to the top 1%. America needs a political revolution.

Today in the United States the top 1% earns more income than the bottom 50%. Does that make sense?

This campaign isn't about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton. It's about the needs of the American people & the ideas to address those needs.

We have a situation where hedge fund managers pay an effective tax rate lower than a truck driver or a nurse. Isn’t it time for a change?

The struggle for equality continues today in America, and the front line of that struggle is the inner cities throughout our nation.

I believe we must not balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the sick and the poor and ask nothing from the wealthy.

I applaud the House for today's vote. While the fight will no doubt continue, it's a victory for America’s working people and environment.

At a time of massive inequality, the Republicans believe that the richest people in America need to be made even richer.

We need pay equity in this country so that women make what a man makes for doing the same work.

No single financial institution should be so large that its failure would cause catastrophic risk to millions of American jobs.

Nothing significant happens in terms of social change unless a strong grassroots movement takes place.
