Today, one family, the Walton family, is worth more than $157 billion - more wealth than the bottom 42 percent, over 130 million Americans.

Every man, woman, and child is entitled to health care. That right exists in virtually every other major country and it’s time to join them.

It is absurd that college graduates today are carrying debts of $50,000, $100,000 or more. We must deal with the issue of student debt.

In my view, If a bank is too big to fail, it's too big to exist. That's the bottom line. #Bernie2016

I am saddened by the senseless deaths of Alison Parker and Adam Ward. Jane and I have their families and friends in our thoughts.

Today, the top one percent owns 41% of wealth in this country. Meanwhile, the bottom sixty percent owns less than 2% of the nation’s wealth.

We need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, and move to 100 percent renewable energy - and we need to act immediately. #Bernie2016

The United States is the only developed nation in the world without guaranteed, paid parental leave. We must guarantee these benefits.
