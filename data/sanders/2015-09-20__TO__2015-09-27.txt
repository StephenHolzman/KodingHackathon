Climate change is a planetary crisis. We have to act now, and we have to act boldly.

Social Security has not contributed one penny to the deficit. It is the most successful government program in our nation's history.

We need to provide a way out of jail back into society and we need to take a hard look at the war on drugs.

We must provide legal status to the undocumented. We need comprehensive immigration reform, and we need a path towards citizenship.

Can't @JebBush and the GOP run a campaign without attacking African Americans, Latinos, Muslims or other people?

Pathetic. @JebBush wants more tax breaks for his billionaire friends while cutting help for working people.

In my view, health care is a right and not a privilege.

This is a party whose ideology is way out of touch with the American people.

It appears that even a conservative speaker like John Boehner is unable to control the extreme right-wing drift of Republicans in the House.

America must defend freedom at home and abroad, but we must seek diplomatic solutions before resorting to military action.

What the pope has been saying in a very profound and deep way is that casino-type capitalism is causing devastating problems.

The pope is right in saying all of us must address the grotesque income and wealth inequality we are seeing throughout the world.

It makes no sense to me that the United States of America has more jails and prisons than colleges and universities.

Thousands of people die every single year because they don't have health insurance. But the media doesn’t cover that. That ain’t big news.

No one, in my view, should be allowed to profit from putting more people behind bars. We must put an end to this shameful industry.

America is a nation of immigrants and we should pursue policies that recognize the value of our immigrant brothers and sisters.
