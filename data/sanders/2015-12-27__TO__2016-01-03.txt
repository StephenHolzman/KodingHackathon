I want to thank the people of Nevada for the support they have given us and the boost that their support will give us as we go forward.

Proud that we brought many working and young people into the political process. We have the wind at our back as we head into Super Tuesday.

I am very proud of the campaign we ran. Five weeks ago we were 25 points behind and we ended up in a very close election.

Glad to hear @HillaryClinton's promise to remove the three and ten year bars against returning immigrants put in place by the Clinton admin.

29 million Americans don’t have health insurance.

31 million are underinsured.

That’s rationing. Those are wait times.

It would be a nice idea for Republicans to read the Constitution of the United States.

The Constitution is very clear: @POTUS has a duty to nominate SCOTUS justices. Let's have a hearing and a vote.

As President, I will make public colleges and universities free, and we’re going to pay for it by putting a tax on Wall Street speculation.

I am running for president because 11 million undocumented people cannot continue living in the shadows.

We need to reduce wasteful spending at the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency that has refused an audit. #DemDebate

When you tell a woman that she cannot control her own body, that's extremism.
