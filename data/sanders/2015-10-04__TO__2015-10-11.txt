Right now a billionaire pays the same amount of money into Social Security as someone who makes $118,500 a year.

At a time when millions cannot afford the prescription drugs they need, we need a leader at the FDA who will stand up to big pharma.

We will no longer tolerate CEOs who threaten to move plants to China if their workers vote in favor of a union.

My view is that a woman has the right to make decisions regarding her own body, not the United States government.

Drug abuse or addiction are illnesses, not crimes, which means more mental health counseling rather than simply sentencing people to jail.

We need to take a hard look at the war on drugs and the number of non-violent offenders whose lives are destroyed by being sent to prison.

Today we have a middle class which has all but disappeared over the past 10 years. Together, we can rebuild America for working families.

Three major drug companies made $45 billion in profit last year. That's obscene when millions of people can't afford drugs.

It’s WRONG to profit from the imprisonment of human beings and the suffering of their friends and families. Plain and simple.

We must provide a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants in our country and we need to keep families together.
