It's not a terribly radical idea that someone working 40 hours a week should not be living in poverty. #BernieinSC

You can’t have it all. You cannot continue to get tax breaks when people across this nation are going hungry.

I believe we should raise the minimum wage to at least 15 bucks an hour so people in this country are not living in poverty.

We are in need of a political revolution that says a billionaire class can't have it all. #Bernie2016

The crowd is starting to build up in Atlanta. It’s clear to me that the message is resonating across the country.

It is unacceptable that total spending on medicine in the United States of America has gone up by more than 90% since 2002.

We aren’t going back. Not only are we not going to retreat on women’s rights, we’re going to expand them. We’re going forward, not backward.

We’ve gotta fight for a vibrant democracy, and for an economy that works for all people and not just a handful of wealthy people.

We have got to do something bold about college tuition and debt. We bailed out Wall Street, now it’s Wall Street’s time to help us out.

What good is it to live in the richest country on earth, if so many of our people cannot afford medications that could save their lives?
