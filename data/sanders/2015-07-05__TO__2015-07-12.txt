We should be providing jobs and education to our young people  rather than spending more and more money on jails and incarceration.

What we need now is an economy that provides decent wages and income for the middle class, not demands that people work even longer hours.

Bush doesn't understand what's happening in our economy today. Americans already work the longest hours in the western industrialized world.
