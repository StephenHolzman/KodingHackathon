Just like Social Security, paid family and medical leave is a program that workers would pay into. Just $1.61 a week for the average worker.

Over 20 percent of mothers who have jobs in America have to go back to work just two weeks after giving birth. That’s unacceptable.

The environment is not for corporations to exploit today, but a treasure to preserve for future generations to enjoy.

They will not support a candidate who wants to give huge tax breaks to billionaires like himself.

They will not support a candidate who thinks climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.

What I’ve been saying loudly and clearly is: We’ve gotta invest in more jobs and education, not jails and incarceration.

Billionaires already own much of our economy. Now, they want to own the United States government as well.

In my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM.

People who graduated in 2014 with student debt owed an average of $30,000 each. That’s unsustainable and unforgivable.

It is not acceptable that so many young people have criminal records for smoking marijuana, while the CEOs of banks do not.

Raids are not the answer. We cannot continue to employ inhumane tactics involving rounding up and deporting thousands of immigrant families.

It makes no sense to give tax breaks to billionaires when we have so many children living in poverty.

It’s not a radical idea to say that someone working 40 hours a week should not be living in poverty. #NVDemsCaucus

We need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, and move to 100 percent renewable energy - and we need to act immediately.

Mom is working, dad is working, teenagers are working longer hours for lower wages. Yet new wealth goes to top 1 percent. #BernieInVegas
