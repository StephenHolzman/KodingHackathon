Are we comfortable with an American political system which is being dominated by a handful of billionaires?

1 out of 4 male African-Americans born today will end up behind bars. That is not the America we believe in. #IDPHOF

When one family spends more money than either of the two major political parties combined that is not democracy, that is oligarchy. #IDPHOF

Today the U.S. remains the only major nation that does not guarantee health care. Now is the time for us to join the rest of the world.

No president, not even the best one, can bring about the changes that we need in this country unless there is a political revolution.

American workers are being denied a benefit that workers in every other advanced economy already enjoy: 10 days of paid vacation time.

If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, do you know what he would say about our huge banks? He would say break 'em up. And he would be right.

It is time to say loudly and clearly that corporate greed and the war against the American middle class must end. Enough is enough!

We need to pass pay equity for women workers. It is not acceptable that women receive less than their male counterparts doing the same job.

The best way to expand the economy is to raise wages and create good jobs to increase the purchasing power of the American people.

Corporations must stop manipulating their shares to reward their executives and billionaire shareholders through the use of stock buybacks.

We should recognize DREAMers for who they are—American kids who deserve the right to legally be in the country they know as home.

We need real tax reform which demands that the very wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.

We aren’t going back. Not only are we not going to retreat on women's rights, we’re going to expand them. We’re going forward, not backward.
