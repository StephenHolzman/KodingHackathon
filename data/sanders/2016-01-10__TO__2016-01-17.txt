Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for the near collapse of our economy. That will change under my administration.

I applaud the president for stopping all new federal coal leases on public lands. We must do all we can to keep fossil fuels in the ground.

It is insane and counter-productive that that millions of kids leave school with a mountain of debt that burdens them for decades.
