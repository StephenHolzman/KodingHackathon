Equal pay for equal work. It’s not a radical idea.

In the year 2015, we should look at a college degree the same way we looked at a high school degree 50 or 60 years ago.

The reason why the American people are angry is that the government is not addressing the real problems that are impacting them every day.

ABC News spent 81 minutes on Donald Trump and only 20 seconds on our campaign. You read that right. Seconds.

I got into politics not to figure out how to become President. I got into politics because I give a damn.

I promise at the end of my first term we won't have more people in jail than in any other country.

It’s time for a single-payer health care system in America. #Bernie2016

I don’t think it’s a radical idea that in the richest country in the history of the world health care should be a right, not a privilege.

The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman, her family and physician to make, not the government.

I want kids whose parents don't— like my parents didn’t — have a lot of money to in fact be able to get a college education tuition free.

We need, very clearly, major, major reform in a broken criminal justice system. From top to bottom.

When we talk about war, we must talk about the 500,000 men and women who came home with PTSD, and traumatic brain injury.

I believe that we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour. And I apologize to nobody for that.

We bailed out Wall Street. It's their time to bail out the middle class and help our kids be able to go to college tuition-free.

It is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids.

In the last 30 years, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth. The problem is this redistribution has gone in the wrong direction.

Billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers. That makes no sense at all. We need real tax reform.

This campaign is relying on small campaign donors, 800,000 of them, 30 bucks a piece. That's who I'm indebted to. Not Wall Street.

It’s fun for the media to treat Trump like a character in a soap opera, but the truth is his language is dangerous.
